but when a player is inside the control place, they cant see anything(also when in: weapon's aim place and ammuntion places). When a ship is being sunk, each player on it will die,
except for ones that got into refuge boats. Refuge-boats can be destructed, they have no weaponary and can just swim to a ground place. Also refuge boats will sink over time. Players can
